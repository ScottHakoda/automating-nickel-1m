Automating Calibration Procedures for the Nickel 1-m Telescope at Lick Observatory

The Nickel 1-m Telescope at Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton is actively used for a variety of astronomical research by faculty, students, and staff both within and outside of the University of California Observatories. At the start of each observation session, astronomers must perform a set of calibration and startup procedures such as bias frames, sky flats, pointing, and focusing. These procedures ensure that the telescope can capture clear images with meaningful detail. Currently, these procedures are inefficient and require significant manual input from the astronomer leaving considerable room for human error. The objective of this project is to maximize the telescope’s observing time by first automating and improving the efficiency of the focusing process. Using image analysis tools, a focus star will be selected and imaged at a range of different focus values. The quality of the focus will then be assessed by measuring specific attributes of the star in each image. Using the information obtained from the quality of the focus at the various focus values, we can then calculate an optimal focus value for that night’s observations. If time permits, optimization of the other startup procedures will also be pursued.
