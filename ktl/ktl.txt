Notes, 10 July 2025

- There are hard limits on the secondary focus value.  These may be
  different between software and hardware.  The minimum is ~165 and the
  maximum is ~500.  Focus script should likely work within this range.

- Note that focus doesn't always lock.  Observers work around this by
  setting a new focus value until the lock engages and then returning to
  the desired focus.  Script should likely include a timeout for the
  lock to engage.

- Add alert sounds in the script so that users know something is wrong?

- Before setting the focusing script loose, would prefer:
    - User should check correct acquision of the focus star
    - Allow user to chose the star to use for focusing
    - Allow user to set the window explicitly

- For the automated FWHM measurement:
    - Build in something that will detect/remove cosmic rays
    - Detect saturation and either adjust exposure time automatically
      and/or warn user
    - Keep track of other failure modes; issue sounds/warnings when they
      can't be handled but always notify user when the script is trying
      to be clever
    - Consider taking multiple exposures at one focus value and
      reporting the mean/median FWHM, instead of only using one image

- Would likely be worth waiting a short amount of time (~1 sec) between
  when the ReadoutDone event is signaled and when to start FWHM
  measurements
    - Might also check for expected file to have been written to disk

- Keep in mind the course vs. fine grained focus option

- There are also cases when the focus can be so off that you can't
  actually see stars in the field.  May want a "focus scanning" mode
  that will help the observer get in the right ballpark.
